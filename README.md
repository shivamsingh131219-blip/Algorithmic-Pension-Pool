# Algorithmic Pension Pool


## Project Description
Algorithmic Pension Pool is a blockchain-based pension management smart contract. Users can contribute funds into a shared pool, and the system calculates pension payouts using a simple algorithm based on each user's contribution ratio.


## Project Vision
The goal is to create a transparent, decentralized pension system where contributions and payouts cannot be manipulated. The project promotes financial inclusion by offering trustless retirement savings.


## Key Features
- Users can deposit (contribute) funds to the pension pool.
- Algorithmic pension calculation based on pool share.
- Secure and transparent fund distribution by contract owner.
- Immutable and auditable record on the blockchain.


## Future Scope
- Automated monthly pension payouts.
- Integration with stablecoins.
- Dynamic contribution-based reward algorithms.
- Governance model for community-driven pension rules.
- Integration with real-world pension schemes.
